    Person Object Creation Exercise Instructions

    Objective:
    Your goal in this exercise is to create a Person class and use it to create a person object based on user input. 
    The Person class should have properties for the person's name, age, address, phone number, and job.

    Detailed Steps:

    1. Define a Person class. This class should have five properties: name, age, address, phoneNumber, and job. 
    The types of these properties should be appropriate for the data they'll hold (for example, `String` for name, 
    `Int` for age, etc.)

    2. In the main part of your program, prompt the user for information to create a new person object. 
    You should ask for their name, age, address, phone number, and job.
        - You can use the `print` function to display prompts to the user, and the `readLine()` function to capture their input.
        - Remember to handle possible input errors, such as the user entering a non-integer value for the age.

    3. Using the user's input, create a new instance of the Person class. 

    4. Print out the details of the Person object to verify that it was created correctly.

    Expected Output:

    The output of your program will depend on the user's input, but it should end with a printout of the 
    newly-created Person object's details.

    Please write your code below this comment block. Good luck!
